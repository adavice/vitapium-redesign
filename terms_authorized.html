          <h3>4. Access to the Ongoing Subscription Model</h3>
          <p>

            request, has provided you with access to the Services. Access to the
            Services can be provided by delivering to you informative or
            entertainment Services (e.g. by delivering downloadable content
            (such as a wallpaper, a ringtone or a mobile game)), by otherwise
            providing access to the Services (e.g. to your mobile number) or by
            enabling you to download the Services (e.g. by delivering a WAP-Push
            link or link in a text message for download or otherwise use of the
            Services on Company website). All subscription agreements shall
            remain in effect until terminated and/or cancelled by you or Company

          <h3>5. Access to the Credit Model</h3>
          <p>
            In the credit model offered by Company, a bundle of credits for a
            defined number of individual downloads is provided on a renewable
            subscription basis. The credit model is an ongoing subscription and
            shall begin when Company has provided the bundle of credits to you.
            Applicable fees and credits will be communicated to you on the
            Website and through our Services. In the credit model, a defined
            number of credits will be provided which entitle you to download,
            receive and/or access that defined number of available downloads.
            The subscription period is depending on the type of the subscription
            contract offered in your country. The subscription contract and the
            subscription period will be renewed each period as applicable and a
            new subscription fee shall become due for the new subscription
            period. The subscription contract shall remain in effect until
            terminated and/or cancelled by you or Company according to the terms
            set out herein. After entering into your subscription agreement and
            upon payment of the applicable subscription fee for the relevant
            subscription period Company will transfer the bundle of download
            credits to your account. The periodic subscription fee shall become
            due every period your subscription agreement is valid irrespective
            of whether or not you actually download any Services during any
            particular subscription period; the consideration for the periodic
            subscription fee shall solely be the periodic provision of the right
            to download, receive and/or access downloadable Services. The number
            of credits for downloads shall be reduced by actual downloaded
            Services. Credits cannot be redeemed for cash, are not transferable
            and are depending on the type of subscription agreement you ordered.
            If you do not use/redeem all your credits within the subscription
            period the unused credits will (a) be rolled over into the next
            subscription period and remain in your account until used/redeemed
            or until expiration or termination of your subscription agreement
            or, if sooner, (b) expire every 90 days after assignment. Credits
            can only be used to download the Services offered by Company.
