            <p>
              A healthy lifestyle is one that helps maintain and improve your
              health and wellness. There are many different things you can do to
              lead a healthy lifestyle, such as eating healthy, being physically
              active, keeping your weight healthy, and dealing with your stress.
              A healthy lifestyle is not just about healthy eating and exercise,
              but also about taking care of the 'whole you' - your physical,
              mental, emotional and spiritual well-being. And that means taking
              care of you from within.
            </p>
            <h3>LIVING A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE</h3>
            <p>
              While there are many common ways to live a healthy lifestyle, it
              actually looks different to everyone and means something from
              person to person. Whatever you choose, a healthy lifestyle is an
              important part of disease prevention, wellness and longevity. When
              you take into account your diet, physical activity and stress
              levels, you can effectively balance all aspects of your life - the
              "whole you." Below are 10 important things you can do to live a
              healthy lifestyle:
            </p>
            <h3>1. EAT A BALANCED DIET</h3>
            <p>
              A balanced diet doesn't have to be a boring diet. As long as
              you're getting enough protein, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals,
              and fats, that piece of chocolate cake you fancy shouldn't be
              doing you too much harm. Enjoy your meals, chew your food
              properly, and eat a variety of foods, including five servings of
              fruits or vegetables a day. Too many processed foods or sugary
              foods can make you feel sluggish.
            </p>

            <p>
              Drink more water. Most of us don't drink enough water every day.
              Water is essential for our body to function. Did you know that
              more than 60% of our body consists of water? Water is needed to
              perform bodily functions, to remove waste and to transport
              nutrients and oxygen throughout our body. Since we lose water
              every day through urine, bowel movements, perspiration and
              breathing, we need to replenish our water intake. Since food
              intake contributes about 20% to our fluid intake, which means we
              need to drink about 8-10 glasses a day to stay hydrated. One way
              to tell if you are hydrated - your urine should be colorless or
              pale yellow. If not, you are not getting enough water! Other signs
              are: dry lips, dry mouth, and little urination.
            </p>

            <p>
              Eat more fruits and vegetables. Fruit contains many vitamins and
              minerals. As much as possible you should consume your vitamins and
              minerals through your daily diet. Satisfy your taste buds with
              these nutritious fruits: watermelon, apricots, avocado (yes,
              avocado is technically a fruit!), Apple, cantaloupe, grapefruit,
              kiwi, guava, papaya, strawberries. Like fruits, vegetables are
              important for good health. Experts suggest 5-9 servings of fruits
              / vegetables per day, but unfortunately it can be difficult at
              times. If possible, eat foods such as kidney beans, black beans,
              asparagus, long beans, green beans, and carrots. Think about your
              favorite vegetables and how to include more of them in your diet
              every day, and choose brightly colored foods. Fruits and
              vegetables with bright colors are good for health as they remove
              things in our body that damage our cells. So, you get fill of
              fruits / vegetables of different colors: White (Bananas,
              Mushroom), Yellow (Pineapple, Mango), Orange (Orange, Papaya), Red
              (Apple, Strawberries, Tomatoes, Watermelon), Green (Guava,
              Avocados) , Cucumber, Lettuce, Celery), Purple / Blue
              (blackberries, aubergine, plums).
            </p>

            <h3>2. TAKE TIME TO RELAX</h3>
            <p>
              Relaxation is very important for a healthy mind. However you relax
              - deep breathing, yoga, fishing, taking a bath, reading a book -
              try to chill for an hour a day if you can. Mental exhaustion can
              cause stress, depression and anxiety disorders. Modern lifestyles
              can be hectic - when you're not working, you're running after the
              kids or racing through the supermarket or doing something else.
              Relax! Take a deep breath. Even fifteen minutes of this is better
              than none, but try for an hour a day.

              Deliberately breathe in deeply. Oxygen is a vital source of life.
              You may know how to breathe, but are you breathing properly? Most
              of us don't breathe properly - we only breathe superficially,
              breathing to 1/3 of our lung capacity. A full breath is one where
              your lungs are completely filled, your abdomen expands, and there
              is minimal movement in your shoulders. There are many benefits of
              deep breathing, including a reduction in stress and blood
              pressure, strengthening of abdominal and intestinal muscles, and
              relief from general body aches. Deep breathing also aids in better
              blood flow, releasing toxins from the body and helping you get a
              better night's sleep.

            <h3>3. GET STARTED!</h3>
            <p>
              There is no excuse not to exercise as there is literally something
              for everyone. Not everyone likes to hit the treadmill or pump iron
              at the gym, but anything that gets your heart rate up is good
              cardiovascular activity. How about playing tennis, meeting a
              friend for a swimming session or self defense or martial arts? If
              you can't think of anything better, run up and down the stairs a
              few times. Feeling Better Now? Exercise releases endorphins, which
              cheer you up.
            </p>
            <p>
              Meditate often. Meditation calms your mind and calms your soul. It
              can also help you deal with and cope with the stress in your life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Exercise regularly. If you can exercise, don't do it a few times a
              week, but every day. Exercise is the key to a healthy life.
              Exercising daily can improve your health in many ways. It can help
              extend your life, lower your risk of disease, help you develop
              higher bone density and lose weight. One simple thing you can do,
              especially for short distances, is to walk, drive, or transport.
              You can climb the stairs instead of taking the elevator. You can
              choose exercises that you can easily do at home or outside and
              that you enjoy. When you enjoy the physical activities of your
              choosing, you will likely enjoy them and naturally want to do
              them. Exercise is about being healthy and having fun at the same
              time. Mixing up your exercises will keep them interesting.

            <h3>4. REDUCE SMOKING AND DRINKING</h3>
            <p>
              Have you ever met a smoker who is glad they started smoking? Me
              neither. It's the most destructive thing you can do to your body.
              Drinking can be harmful if you drink or drink too much alcohol,
              but, like most things, moderation is key. In fact, a glass of red
              wine has proven to be good for the heart. But too much can be
              devastating to your health. Smoking can significantly increase the
              risk of lung cancer, kidney cancer, esophageal cancer, heart
              attack, and more. Smoking "light" cigarettes also does not reduce
              health risks. If you smoke, quit now and do it not only for
              yourself, but for your family and friends as well. Secondhand
              smoking (breathing smokers' air) can cause many of the same
              long-term illnesses as direct smoking. There is no risk-free level
              of secondhand smoke; even brief exposure can be harmful to your
              health. If possible, stay away from smokers and avoid cigarette
              smoke whenever possible.
            </p>

            <h3>5. REDUCE OILY AND SUGARY FOOD, SOFT DRINKS AND CAFEINE</h3>
            <p>
              If possible, reduce your intake of fast foods, French fries,
              donuts, chips, wedges, and fried foods. Not only are they very
              fattening (1 tablespoon of oil is 120 calories), fried foods
              contain acrylamide, a potential cancer-causing chemical. There are
              better alternatives, such as grilled, steamed, stir-fried or even
              raw foods. Eating less sugar is also better for your health. These
              are things like candy bars, pastries, chocolates, cookies, cakes
              and jelly donuts. Not only do they not fill you, they make you
              want to eat more because of the sugar rush. Instead, opt for
              healthy snacks such as fruits, salads, pure juices, and whole
              foods. Beverages with caffeine are diuretics, which means that
              they accelerate the rate of urine production. This means that they
              don't hydrate you as well as regular water can. Soda is also
              unhealthy, causes weight gain, and is an artificial stimulant.
              Instead, replace your soda with water or vegetable juices.
